//TODO

- bug resetting video playhead on laptop open.
- mobile



- flow g is large (14MB) and comes second - sometimes not loading on mobile for a while.
- same with flow c (20MB)
- hybrid assets - can we fit these in one window somehow?
- flow f (delightful web and mobile) blue background
- flow k is grainy (form management that isn't a hassle)
- making the laptop transition more seamless - t/s bug with video not seeking to start of playhead
